# NovoDexUI
 This is an iOS app with Swift, proyected to demonstrate my knowledge in the mobile development area
 This App uses te https://pokeapi.co/api/

  - [x] type or types
  - [x] Abilities

  - [x] Stats
- [x] UIKit or SwiftUI (SwiftUI)
- [x] IPhone and IPad compatibility
- [x] VIP, VIPER or MVP Architecture (MVP)

# Developer Notes

 I consider that the MVP Architecture was the most apropiate for this app because the logic behind the app is not that complex, its almost a copy an paste of behaviors, the data comes from just one side and the navigation requirements are easy to implement in almost any case.
 The app is builded in SwiftUI because most of the initial projects in UIKit tend to drain more time just modeling the navigations, the requirements for segues, storyboards or XIBs makes the app to take longer for be build in such a shor time (2 days)
